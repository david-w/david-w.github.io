I was in a jam.

It's a long boring story, but the super condensed backstory is at work, we need a Mac running a specific older version of OS X around 10.6.  Currently, we have an old MacPro tower that we use and recently it has been showing it's age.  It started out as random lock ups that could be fixed with a reboot.  As the problem progressed, occasionally the screen would start flashing.

As it got worse, I knew I needed to take care of it but had other more pressing problems to deal with.  I found that other people had solved similar issues by restarting in safe mode which doesn't load all the kernel extensions. Some theorized that there was an OS update that was not compatible with the older video hardware that was in this box (NVidia GeForce 7300GT).  


There are just a few video cards that work in this box, none of which are still manufactured.
