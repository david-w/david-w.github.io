## Mazda CX-9 3.7L Fuel Injector Replacement

As I was leaving work yesterday, I felt it as soon as I started my car.  By "it" I mean a misfire.  I won't explain the feeling because if you are reading this, then you likely already know what I'm talking about.  

So it was running on 5 cylinders. I had somewhere important to be, so I had to think fast. 9 times out of 10 on newer model cars, a non-firing cylinder means a bad coil which is an easy fix.  

Without my code reader, I was about to do a quick and dirty process to figure out which cylinder wasn't firing by pulling the coil wires off one at a time while the engine was running. (I DO NOT recommend doing this, ever) When you find the wire that doesn't make it run even crappier than it already is, then that's the bad cylinder.  I say I was about to do that because when I looked across the parking lot to the auto repair shop next door the guy was still there.  He read the code for me: Number 2 fuel injector.  Not quite as easy as replacing a coil.  

So I drove it. I'm not saying this is a good idea. In fact I know it's not a good idea.  Understand that I would NEVER drive a car that had a failed coil.  Without spark, the fuel still enters the cylinder but doesn't burn. That's bad. It will destroy your catalytic converter(s).  My situation was different. The cylinder was getting spark but no fuel, so it's just doing nothing really.  I drove it, and it's all good.

Today, I borrowed a car to get to work and I picked up the parts.  It's not very difficult to do but it takes some time.

1. Take the fuel cap off, unless you want a face full of gas when you disconnect the fuel rail.  Also disconnect the battery.

2. Remove the air box.
