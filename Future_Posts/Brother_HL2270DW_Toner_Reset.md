So I handle all the IT where I work.  I took a day off, and when I returned the next day the shipping / receiving person came to me and said he had a printer problem that I needed to look at. He added that it was not urgent because he was able to print since he borrowed the owner's printer.      
**HUH?**

The printer in question is a Brother, model HL2270DW.  Apparently, it just stopped working and reported the toner was out. A new cartridge was installed but the printer still would not print. (I think there is more to the story than this.)

After messing around with the printer for an hour, I stumbled on [this solution][sol]!
