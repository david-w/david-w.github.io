I have administered mostly Linux and MacOS for years.  Recently, I switched companies and my new place uses almost exclusively Windows.  Honestly, Windows has come a long way.  I can say it's not nearly as clunky and limited as it used to be.  As a systems administrator, I jump around to different servers a lot.  Microsoft Remote Desktop is pretty nice. Between RDP and Hyper-V VMs, it works seamlessly.  

Even the few MacOS users here can RDP into Windows VMs with ease.  I have 2 users however that want me to configure something that has me stumped so far.  
21" Retina display iMacs with multiple monitors works with RDP, but monitor configuration is beyond frustrating. The users have 3 displays. The iMac, and 2 external displays using Thunderbolt ports. What they want should be easy, but it's not.  They want the iMac to display as normal using all 3 displays, and then after launching RDP and logging in to a Windows VM have MacOS on the main iMac display and have Windows take the other two.  
Mac on the left, and Windows on the center and the right displays.  With RDP on PC, you can edit the RDP config file and specify which displays to use, but not on the mac version.  It's either use all displays or just one. 

Working it out.
