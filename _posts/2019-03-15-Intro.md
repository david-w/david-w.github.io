This site is for me really.  I write like I'm talking to you, but I am mostly talking to me.  It's a place where I can record things that I have done, want to do, or afraid I will forget.  


I love technical challenges. That's what motivates me. The problem is once I figure something out, I'm inclined to forget about it as time passes.  Sometimes I have the same sort of problem months or years later, and don't remember the solution. So this is kind of a storage dump for whatever I am doing.  Hopefully I will find it useful and not a time-suck.  If it works out, I may start to post some stuff from old projects that I have had stashed elsewhere.


I'm using Jekyll for the site and hosting on Github Pages.  Jekyll is a very cool and fairly simple static site generator that converts markdown files to static html files. You can check it out [here](https://jekyllrb.com). The basic workflow is simple once it's set up.  I create markdown files in a text-editor, then Jekyll grabs them and converts to html. Jekyll will serve those files locally so I can check them out, and then I can copy them to whatever web server I am using.  Even easier is that I use Git and Github Pages.  So once I like what I see locally, I just commit to my local Git repository and then push it up to GitHub via ssh.  Github Pages runs on Jekyll, so it will be live almost instantly.  Since I use Bundler to handle my Ruby gems , I can be sure that what I see local will look the same when I push it to my Github repository.  **Nice**.
